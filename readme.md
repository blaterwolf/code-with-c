# Code with C

This is the Activity file I used on my Presentation/Talk on the Challenges and Proccesses for Coding C Language. 

I ran the file using `gcc FullActivity.c -o FullActivity` then execute the file on the command by typing `FullActivity`. Please take note to download the MINGW C Compiler to run on your VSCode Environment via the Windows Terminal which you can watch on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWSpJWRqxkw).

Enjoy playing around with the Activity and use Visual Studio Code while you are on it!
